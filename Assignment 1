Is gender independent of education level? A random sample of 395 people were
surveyed and each person was asked to report the highest education level they
obtained. The data that resulted from the survey is summarized in the following table:

        High School     Bachelors     Masters    Ph.d.     Total
Female      60              54          46        41        201
Male        40              44          53        57        194
Total       100             98          99        98        395

Question: Are gender and education level dependent at 5% level of significance? In
other words, given the data collected above, is there a relationship between the gender
of an individual and the level of education that they have obtained?

Solution:

Here's the table of expected counts as

	E =  (Row total × Column total)/(Sample Size)
  
        High School     Bachelors     Masters    Ph.d.     Total
Female      50.886	      49.868	      50.377	  49.868	  201
Male        49.114	      48.132	      48.623	  48.132	  194
Total       100	          98	          99	      98	      395

So, working this out,  χ2 = (60-50.886)^2/50.886 + ... + (57-48.132)^2/48.132 = 8.006
The critical value of χ2 with 3 degree of freedom is 7.815. Since 8.006 > 7.815, 
therefore we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the education level depends 
on gender at a 5% level of significance.
